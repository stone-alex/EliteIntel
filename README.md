## Overview

Elite Intel is your AI-powered, TOS-compliant sidekick for *Elite Dangerous*.
It's a Quality of Life (QoL) app that enhances gameplay with voice-activated commands 
**uttered in natural language**,
real-time journal parsing, and smart AI assistance—all while staying fully compliant
with Frontier Developments' Terms of Service. No AFK play, no botting, and no
automation that gives unfair advantages; everything requires your input.

The app uses Google Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) for **natural voice interactions**,
and either OpenAI's GPT or xAI's Grok for handling commands, queries, and chats. It processes 
game data from journal and auxiliary files, pulls in info from EDSM when needed, and keeps 
things responsive.
