## Overview

Elite Intel is your AI-powered, TOS-compliant sidekick for *Elite Dangerous*.
It's a Quality of Life (QoL) app that enhances gameplay with voice-activated commands 
**uttered in natural language**,
real-time journal parsing, and smart AI assistance—all while staying fully compliant
with Frontier Developments' Terms of Service. No AFK play, no botting, and no
automation that gives unfair advantages; everything requires your input.

The app uses Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) for **natural voice interactions**,
and LLM for handling commands, queries, and chats. It processes game data from journal 
and auxiliary files, pulls in info from EDSM when needed, and keeps things responsive.
