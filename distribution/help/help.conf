"carrier routing"="I use Spansh to plot routes. Open any Galaxy Map, select your target star, and copy its name using the last button in the right hand column. After that say: Calculate Fleet Carrier Route—I’ll grab the star, check your carrier’s position, and save a Spansh route. If Spansh misses your current system, I’ll find the closest known star. However if target system is not in Spansh you will have to repeat the process until we find one that is. To jump: open the Fleet Carrier Map, place the cursor in to the text field and when ready ask me to Enter next Fleet Carrier destination, and I’ll paste the next system. Schedule the jump in-game and repeat."
"commodity search"="Need to buy a commodity like Tritium or Bromellite? Say Where can I buy Tritium? and I’ll search EDSM for markets within 250 light years, save the info, and tell you, Found 5 markets for Tritium! To head there, say Navigate to the best market—I’ll plot a route to the cheapest system’s station via your Galaxy Map (be in the cockpit). Forgot the station? Ask Where’s the market located? and I’ll remind you. Note: Speech-to-text may trip on names like Grandidierite—add fixes like grande=grandidierite to the dictionary directory in my install. EDSM data isn’t real-time, so prices or stock may vary."
"custom commands"="I can execute most of the game controls, but I will not fire weapons or switch to silent running. Other than key-mapping for the game controls I can do some custom commands. Say All power to shields, engines, weapons, or Equalize power to instantly rebalance pips. Say Exit to HUD to quickly escape nested menus and return to your heads-up display. Say Clear Codex Entries to wipe scanned entries, but use cautiously. Say Clear Cache to reset the session—careful, it’s a big reset. Say Plot Route to Fleet Carrier to chart a course to your carrier’s last known location. Say Take Me Home to navigate to your set home system. Say Set as home system to mark your current system as home. Say Set optimal speed to hit 75% throttle in supercruise, avoiding station overshoots. There are other commands and queries. Just talk to me and get to know me."
"exobiology"="Hunting bio samples like Fungoida in rough terrain? I have a plan to keep you on track. Fly low, spot bio colonies, and zap them with your Composition Analyzer to log a Codex Entry. This saves your ship’s coords in me (stay close to the sample) and may earn 50k credits. Tag all species you find. Land within 2 km if possible, or take an SRV trip—I’ll guide you. Say Navigate to nearest codex entry or Navigate to next bio sample, and I’ll lead you to the closest tagged spot. Scan a sample like Frutexa, and I’ll know to focus on that type for your next navigation request. Keep scanning until done. I use your Codex tag coords, so scan up close. More tags give me more spots to guide you to."
"exploration"="Exploring a new star system? I’ll help you. On entering an uncharted system, if discovery announcements are on, I’ll let you know if you’re the first to get here! To scan, say: Open FSS and scan, or just say Hunk! — I’ll will prep the FSS for you to hunt planets and signals. As you scan, I will only announce interesting stuff, like high-value planets, or ones with exobiology. After you scan everything, ask me anything about the data you have collected. You can toggle my automated Discovery announcements On or Off. Just ask."
"pirate missions"="I’ll track your massacre missions. Find a system on INARA with a Haz RES and stack missions targeting one pirate faction. During the mission, I’ll call out Non-Mission wanted ships as Legal Target plus [ship type], [rank], [bounty], or if the target faction matches mission I will announce it as Mission Target! I stay silent on clean ships. After a kill, I confirm with Kill Confirmed or Mission Kill Confirmed plus bounty awarded. You can ask me questions about pirate mission progress such as kills left, potential profits, bounties collected etc."
"planetary navigation"="Targeting a specific spot like material coords or a bio sample? I will guide you to the target on the ground. Say Navigate to latitude 41.435, longitude -75.230 (or your coordinates), and I’ll guide you from orbit to surface. In supercruise, keep medium speed to catch my voice prompts—too fast, you’ll miss turns; too slow, you might drop early. Landing on the Dark side? Fly by instruments like a pro. At ~400 km, I’ll give glide angle updates, like glide angle, -35 degrees—you decide to glide or adjust. After gliding, I’ll guide you to within 1,000 meters, and prompt you with: Find a parking spot. In your SRV or on foot, I’ll keep directing until you’re 50 meters from the target. Want out? Say Cancel navigation, and I’ll stop, no fuss."
"system settings"="Customize my settings with natural language. Say Turn Route Announcements On to hear about jumps, like scoopable stars or system security—say Off to silence it (default: On). Say Turn Discovery Announcements On for alerts on first-mapped systems or high-value planets—Off keeps it quiet (default: On). Say Add Mining Target Painite to flag prospector limpet hits for that material—unset by default. Say Turn On Radio for spicy transmissions like pirate threats, but I will skip boring chatter like cruise ship spam. (default: Off). Ask me for route or discovery details anytime."
"available queries"="There are too many queries to list. In general, I can provide data analysis on just about everything I have access to. Provided the data acquisition has been implemented. I can also tap in to my own knowledge including subjects outside of Elite Dangerous universe."
