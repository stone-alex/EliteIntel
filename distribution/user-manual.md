# EliteIntel AI Queries & Commands Guide

Hey Commander! This is a reference for the kinds of things you can ask or tell your **Elite Intel** sidekick.
**Ideally - You don't need to memorize any of these** - just speak naturally, and the app figures out what you mean. This
list exists so you know what's possible, not so you can recite scripts.

## First thing first. Having trouble?

- If app is firing random commands for no reason: brain problem (LLM is weak or configuration is wonky)
- If app is firing commands, but they do not activate: hands problem (Key bindings)
- If app can't hear you well: ears problem (noisy room low noise-to-rms ratio, audio not calibrated etc)
- If app does not speak: mouth problem. Audio connection is not routed properly or routed to an audio end point that you are not monitoring check audio routing at OS level.

### [Full Wiki is here](https://github.com/stone-alex/EliteIntel/wiki)

## Audio Input

**Calibrate the audio in the app**. If the difference between Noise Floor and RMS is too low (e.g. less than 400) the
app will have hard time understanding you. A good ratio is at least 800-1000. Speakers and mic do not go together.
Headphones and mic are recommended.

## App

## 💬 General Chat (Conversation Mode must be ON)

By default the app runs in **Strict Mode**: if input doesn't match a known command or query it is silently ignored.
This is intentional — it prevents STT noise and background chatter from triggering random actions mid-flight.

Enable **Conversation Mode** in the Settings tab to turn on free-form chat. When on, anything that doesn't match a
command falls back to general conversation — game lore, real-world topics, ship builds, whatever. The AI is not just
a command parser when you want it to be more.

Local LLMs will respond but will be stiff. Cloud LLMs (Claude, OpenAI, xAI) are recommended for conversation.
